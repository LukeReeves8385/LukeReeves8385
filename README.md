## Hi there 👋

Hey there! 👋 I’m a full-stack developer focused on building end-to-end web applications with real-world functionality. This repository documents my journey into integrating payment systems using Stripe, along with handling webhooks to manage events and automate backend workflows.

Payments are a critical part of many modern applications, and Stripe offers a powerful, developer-friendly platform to implement secure, scalable transactions. I’ve been learning how to work with the Stripe API to set up checkout flows, process one-time and recurring payments, manage subscriptions, and handle customer data.

Beyond the frontend integration, I’m also exploring how webhooks can be used to react to events like successful payments, failed charges, subscription changes, and more. I’m building backend endpoints that securely receive and verify these events, then trigger updates to databases, send confirmation emails, or adjust user access accordingly.

This repository contains example projects, test scripts, and reusable code that show how to bring all these pieces together. From frontend forms to backend logic, each component is designed to be modular, clean, and easy to adapt to different use cases—whether it's an e-commerce site, SaaS platform, or donation page.

I’m focusing on writing code that’s not just functional, but also secure and well-documented. If you’re looking to learn Stripe integration or understand how webhooks work in a full-stack environment, feel free to dive in, explore, or even contribute.

Thanks for stopping by! Payments don’t have to be painful—with the right tools and approach, they can be seamless and reliable. 💳⚙️🌐
